FramePack Studio is an AI video generation application based on FramePack that strives to provide everything you need to create high quality video projects.

## Current Features

- **F1, Original and Video Extension Generations**: Run all in a single queue
- **End Frame Control for 'Original' Model**: Provides greater control over generations
- **Upscaling and Post-processing**
- **Timestamped Prompts**: Define different prompts for specific time segments in your video
- **Prompt Blending**: Define the blending time between timestamped prompts
- **LoRA Support**: Works with most (all?) Hunyuan Video LoRAs
- **Queue System**: Process multiple generation jobs without blocking the interface. Import and export queues.
- **Metadata Saving/Import**: Prompt and seed are encoded into the output PNG, all other generation metadata is saved in a JSON file that can be imported later for similar generations.
- **Custom Presets**: Allow quick switching between named groups of parameters. A custom Startup Preset can also be set.
- **I2V and T2V**: Works with or without an input image to allow for more flexibility when working with standard Hunyuan Video LoRAs
- **Latent Image Options**: When using T2V you can generate based on a black, white, green screen, or pure noise image

## Prerequisites

- CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 8GB VRAM (16GB+ recommended)
- 16GB System Memory (32GB+ strongly recommended)
- 80GB+ of storage (including ~25GB for each model family: Original and F1)

## Documentation

For information on installation, configuration, and usage, please visit our [documentation site](https://docs.framepackstudio.com/).

## Installation

Please see [this guide](https://docs.framepackstudio.com/docs/get_started/) on our documentation site to get FP-Studio installed.

## LoRAs

Add LoRAs to the /loras/ folder at the root of the installation. Select the LoRAs you wish to load and set the weights for each generation. Most Hunyuan LoRAs were originally trained for T2V, it's often helpful to run a T2V generation to ensure they're working before using input images.

NOTE: Slow lora loading is a known issue

## Working with Timestamped Prompts

You can create videos with changing prompts over time using the following syntax:

```
[0s: A serene forest with sunlight filtering through the trees ]
[5s: A deer appears in the clearing ]
[10s: The deer drinks from a small stream ]
```

Each timestamp defines when that prompt should start influencing the generation. The system will (hopefully) smoothly transition between prompts for a cohesive video.
